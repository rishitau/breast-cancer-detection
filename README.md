## ➲The Dataset
## ➲Dataset Description
The Data description is as follows:

- diagnosis: The diagnosis of breast tissues (1 = malignant, 0 = benign) where malignant denotes that the disease is harmful

- mean_radius: mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter

- mean_texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values

- mean_perimeter: mean size of the core tumor

- mean_area: mean area of the core tumor

- mean_smoothness: mean of local variation in radius lengths
